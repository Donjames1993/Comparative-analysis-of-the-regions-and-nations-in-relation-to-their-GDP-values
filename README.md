# Comparative-analysis-of-the-regions-and-nations-in-relation-to-their-GDP-values
Compared the GDP of different regions. The regions that are taken for consideration are Europe, East Asia &amp; Pacific, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Along with GDP other development indicators and 21 years data are also taken into account. It helps to get an understanding how GDP is related to them and over a period.

## GDP by Country name

The Doughnut Economics Model served as the basis for this chart. This graph provides a clear representation of the distribution of countries' GDP. Just two countries—Japan, and Germany—make up over half of the gross domestic product (GDP). In fact, the GDP of Japan alone is greater than the combined GDP of other countries except Germany and United Kingdom. Japan makes a significant contribution to GDP, Cameroon and Senegal are the countries with least GDP.

## GDP by Year and Region
When we wish to compare how data change over time relative to one another or display how the value of something varies over time, line graphs (also known as line charts) work best. From this chart it can be seen that, GDP is increasing over the years. But during 2009 and 2020, a decline in GDP growth can be seen. It is because of the recession happened in 2009 and Corona in 2020. 
If a country’s economy is getter weaker and weaker over several months or even years, it is called Recession. This can be understood by evaluating negative gross domestic product (GDP), growing unemployment, declining retail sales, and contraction income and manufacturing metrics over an extended period. Different techniques are used to calculate this. Commonly used way is rule of thumb. If two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth indicate a recession. From the peak of the previous expansion to the low point of the downturn, economists calculate the length of a recession. Recessions may only last a few months, but it takes time for the economy to reach to its previous value.
For East Asia and the Pacific and Europe, the effects of the recession on GDP growth are clear, although Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are not so affected.
In addition to this it can also be observed that, Europe has the highest GDP value, followed by East Asia & Pacific and so on. Sub Saharan Africa has the lowest GDP value.

## GDP and other indicators by region
A clustered chart is excellent for making relative comparisons within categories. The chart shows many categories and how they relate to one another. Firstly, let’s take Europe. The value of GDP is high in this region, followed by Gross national expenditure and so on. Manufacturing value added comes the lowest in this region. Except Gross capital formation and Manufacturing value added, every other indicator value comes highest compared to other regions. 
East Asia and the Pacific is an area where the GDP is high, followed by gross domestic product and so on. In this region, exports are the lowest. This region has the largest gross capital formation when compared to all other regions.
In the case of South Asia, the value of Gross national expenditure is high, followed by GDP and so on. Current expenses are more than the amount of income obtained when budget deficit occurs. In this case government should increase revenue-generating activities or reduce specific. Otherwise, it increases borrowing, higher interest costs, and insufficient reinvestment. This again result in the reduction of revenue for the next year. Manufacturing value added comes the lowest in this region.
The same thing happens in the case of Sub-Saharan Africa. The value of Gross national expenditure is high, followed by GDP and so on. Here also budget deficit occurs and sufficient measures to be taken. Compared to all other regions, the values of indicators come lowest in this region.

## CAGR of GDP by Region
While a vertical chart of the same data lacks sufficient horizontal space between bars, a horizontal chart of the same data allows you to display those numbers naturally. Horizontal chart is both easier to build and read. Europe and East Asia & Pacific rank last in terms of GDP CAGR even though their GDP values are greater. This shows more economic growth in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa compared to other two regions in these regions. In comparison to other regions, South Asia has the highest GDP growth, whereas Europe is lowest.
